# A Mobile Weather App!

Hey, this was fun. Following along an extracurricular activity from prime, I was able to put together a basic mobile app!

### New Technologies 
  - React Native
  - Weather API
  - GPS Location API

This project allowed me to explore React-Native for the first time. From the TouchableOpacity component to the weather API, I was able to gain basic understandings of how to work on the React-Native platform.
